summary: I'm a professional with 6 years\' solid experience in banking as a financial advisor. My passion for IT was born at a very young age and has stayed with me to this day. While working at the bank, I constantly identified areas for improvement in my work tools. The desire to create and enhance the tools used by software and application users led me to transition my career focus. My goal is to become a full-stack developer.During my intensive technical diploma (AEC) in web and mobile application development, I collaborated on the creation of a mobile application called "Dors-tu bébé". This application generates stories for young children using the OpenAI/ChatGPT API and allows them to be narrated using OpenAI's voice function. It was developed using Kotlin/Java, Firebase, and MongoDB, all within Android Studio.This experience has only heightened my thirst for knowledge and discovery. It drives me to continuously learn and improve in the IT field. My ambition is to become an excellent developer, capable of actively contributing to the advancement of technologies.
