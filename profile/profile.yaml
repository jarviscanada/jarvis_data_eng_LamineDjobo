summary: I'm a professional with 6 years\' solid experience in banking as a financial advisor. My passion for IT was born at a very young age and has stayed with me to this day. While working at the bank, I constantly identified areas for improvement in my work tools. The desire to create and enhance the tools used by software and application users led me to transition my career focus. My goal is to become a full-stack developer.During my intensive technical diploma (AEC) in web and mobile application development, I collaborated on the creation of a mobile application called "Dors-tu bébé". This application generates stories for young children using the OpenAI/ChatGPT API and allows them to be narrated using OpenAI's voice function. It was developed using Kotlin/Java, Firebase, and MongoDB, all within Android Studio.This experience has only heightened my thirst for knowledge and discovery. It drives me to continuously learn and improve in the IT field. My ambition is to become an excellent developer, capable of actively contributing to the advancement of technologies.

# List of Jarvis projects
jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Cluster Monitor"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: "Developed a Linux-based monitoring tool to track and manage server performance across a cluster. Implemented in Bash and SQL, this tool automates the collection of hardware specifications and resource usage data, storing the information in a PostgreSQL database.Performed manual testing on the local machine for each script and command.. Leveraged cron jobs for scheduled monitoring and real-time alerts. Utilized Git for version control and collaboration, ensuring efficient project management and deployment. This project showcases expertise in shell scripting and database integration within a Linux environment."

  - name: "Sql learning"
    git_url: "/sql"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: " Designed to help you learn and practice SQL by setting up and interacting with a PostgreSQL database. It involves loading a pre-defined database schema and data, and then testing your SQL skills by answering around 30 different queries related to the data. The database is organized into several tables within a schema named cd, which manages information about club facilities, members, and bookings. The tests are performed manually directly within the PostgreSQL instance, which is deployed using Docker. Git is used for version control throughout the project."

  - name: "Java Grep program"
    git_url: "/core_java/grep"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: "The Java Grep application is a command-line tool designed for system administrators and developers who need to search through large directories of text files for specific patterns. It mimics the functionality of the Unix grep command, allowing users to recursively search through files and output matching lines to a specified file. The application is implemented using Core Java, with loops and enhancements like Stream API and Lambda expressions for efficient data processing. Logging is handled via SLF4J with Log4j, and the application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment. Comprehensive testing was conducted manually to ensure reliability across different scenarios, including large files and nested directories. "
