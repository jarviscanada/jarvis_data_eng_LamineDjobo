  Of his self-love to stop posterity?  
  Calls back the lovely April of her prime,
  Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,
  The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
    No love toward others in that bosom sits
  For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any
  Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,
  Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?
    Make thee another self for love of me,
  O that you were your self, but love you are
    O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,
    And all in war with Time for love of you,
  Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
  O carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
    My love shall in my verse ever live young.
    Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.
  O let me true in love but truly write,
  And then believe me, my love is as fair,
  O therefore love be of thyself so wary,
  The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
  And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
  O'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might:  
  Who plead for love, and look for recompense,
    O learn to read what silent love hath writ,
    To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.
    Then happy I that love and am beloved
  Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
    Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,
    For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,
  And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe,
  And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,
  Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,
  Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
  Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,
    Their images I loved, I view in thee,
  These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover:  
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  A dearer birth than this his love had brought
    Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love'.
    Yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth,
    Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
  Such civil war is in my love and hate,
  Although our undivided loves are one:
  In our two loves there is but one respect,
  Which though it alter not love's sole effect,
  Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.
    But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
  I make my love engrafted to this store:
  And our dear love lose name of single one,
  To entertain the time with thoughts of love,
  Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all,
  No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call,
  Then if for my love, thou my love receivest,
  I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest,
  And yet love knows it is a greater grief
  And yet it may be said I loved her dearly,
  A loss in love that touches me more nearly.  
  Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her,
  If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
    Sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone.
  In tender embassy of love to thee,
    And my heart's right, thy inward love of heart.
  Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother;  
  With my love's picture then my eye doth feast,
  And in his thoughts of love doth share a part.
  So either by thy picture or my love,
  When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,
  When love converted from the thing it was
    Since why to love, I can allege no cause.
  His rider loved not speed being made from thee:
  Thus can my love excuse the slow offence,
  Therefore desire (of perfect'st love being made)
  But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,
    And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
    You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.
  Sweet love renew thy force, be it not said
  So love be thou, although to-day thou fill
  The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness:
  Return of love, more blest may be the view.
    So true a fool is love, that in your will,
  O no, thy love though much, is not so great,
  It is my love that keeps mine eye awake,
  Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,
  Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye,
  Mine own self-love quite contrary I read:
  Against my love shall be as I am now
  My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life.
  That Time will come and take my love away.  
    That in black ink my love may still shine bright.
    Save that to die, I leave my love alone.
  For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
  The hand that writ it, for I love you so,
  But let your love even with my life decay.
  What merit lived in me that you should love
  After my death (dear love) forget me quite,
  O lest your true love may seem false in this,
  That you for love speak well of me untrue,
    And so should you, to love things nothing worth.
    This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
    To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.
  O know sweet love I always write of you,
  And you and love are still my argument:
    So is my love still telling what is told.
  I grant (sweet love) thy lovely argument
    The worst was this, my love was my decay.
  And do so love, yet when they have devised,
  But that is in my thought, whose love to you
    Such is my love, to thee I so belong,
  Thou canst not (love) disgrace me half so ill,
  Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,
    For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.
  Thy love is better than high birth to me,
  And life no longer than thy love will stay,
  For it depends upon that love of thine.  
  Happy to have thy love, happy to die!
  Like a deceived husband, so love's face,
  May still seem love to me, though altered new:
  That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell,
  How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame,
  Both grace and faults are loved of more and less:
    But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
  If not from my love's breath? The purple pride
  In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed.
  Rise resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,
    Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,
  Both truth and beauty on my love depends:
  My love is strengthened though more weak in seeming,
  I love not less, though less the show appear,
  That love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming,  
  Our love was new, and then but in the spring,
  Let not my love be called idolatry,
  Nor my beloved as an idol show,
  Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
  In praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights,
  Can yet the lease of my true love control,  
  My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,
  That may express my love, or thy dear merit?
  So that eternal love in love's fresh case,
    Finding the first conceit of love there bred,
  That is my home of love, if I have ranged,
  And worse essays proved thee my best of love.
  A god in love, to whom I am confined.
  Your love and pity doth th' impression fill,
  And that your love taught it this alchemy?
    That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.
  Even those that said I could not love you dearer,
  Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,'
  Admit impediments, love is not love
    I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
  Forgot upon your dearest love to call,  
    The constancy and virtue of your love.
  Thus policy in love t' anticipate
  And ruined love when it is built anew  
  Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score,
  If my dear love were but the child of state,
  As subject to time's love or to time's hate,
  O thou my lovely boy who in thy power,
  Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.
  I love to hear her speak, yet well I know,
    And yet by heaven I think my love as rare,
  Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;
  Thine eyes I love, and they as pitying me,
  Thus far for love, my love-suit sweet fulfil.
  'Will', will fulfil the treasure of thy love,
    Make but my name thy love, and love that still,
  When my love swears that she is made of truth,
  O love's best habit is in seeming trust,
  And age in love, loves not to have years told.
  Let me excuse thee, ah my love well knows,
  Though not to love, yet love to tell me so,
  In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,  
  But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
  And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,
  Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov'st those,
  Two loves I have of comfort and despair,
  My love is as a fever longing still,
  My reason the physician to my love,  
  O me! what eyes hath love put in my head,
  If it be not, then love doth well denote,
  How can it? O how can love's eye be true,  
    O cunning love, with tears thou keep'st me blind,
  Canst thou O cruel, say I love thee not,
    But love hate on for now I know thy mind,  
  Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,
  O though I love what others do abhor,
    If thy unworthiness raised love in me,
    More worthy I to be beloved of thee.
  Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
  Triumph in love, flesh stays no farther reason,
    Her love, for whose dear love I rise and fall.
  But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing,
  In vowing new hate after new love bearing:
  Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,
  And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
    Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.
    That shall attend his love.

    When he did need your loves; and do you think
    How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
    That love the fundamental part of state
  BRUTUS. Merely awry. When he did love his country,
    For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
    In asking their good loves; but thou wilt frame
    Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,
    Supplied with worthy men! plant love among's!
    Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love
    As reek o' th' rotten fens, whose loves I prize  
    Requite your love!
    Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love,
    My birthplace hate I, and my love's upon
    As hotly and as nobly with thy love
    The senators and patricians love him too.
  BRUTUS. Only make trial what your love can do
    Thy general is my lover. I have been
    particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than thy old father
    Was to send him; for whose old love I have-
    No more infected with my country's love
    Such parting were too petty. Look here, love:
    It is a manacle of love; I'll place it
  CLOTEN. And that she should love this fellow, and refuse me!

    When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,
    An eminent monsieur that, it seems, much loves  
    Which you know cannot err. The love I bear him
  CLOTEN. Still I swear I love you.  
    I barely gratify your love; they failing,
    Where there is beauty; truth where semblance; love
    Upon the love, and truth, and vows, which I
    Let what is here contain'd relish of love,
    For it doth physic love- of his content,  
    am in Cambria, at Milford Haven. What your own love will out of
    remains loyal to his vow, and your increasing in love
    The innocent mansion of my love, my heart.
    That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me
    Or, wing'd with fervour of her love, she's flown
  CLOTEN. I love and hate her; for she's fair and royal,
    Outsells them all. I love her therefore; but
    He is a man. I'll love him as my brother;
    thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is! Posthumus, thy
  GUIDERIUS. I love thee; I have spoke it.
    As I do love my father.
    I love this youth, and I have heard you say
    I love thee brotherly, but envy much
  BOTH.      All lovers young, all lovers must
    These present wars shall find I love my country,

    You snatch some hence for little faults; that's love,
    Whom best I love I cross; to make my gift,
  CORNELIUS. Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love  
    I love thee more and more; think more and more
    Hearing us praise our loves of Italy
    Most like a noble lord in love and one
    That had a royal lover, took his hint;
  BELARIUS. [To GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS] Though you did love this
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?

    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.

    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    With all my love I do commend me to you;
    May do t' express his love and friending to you,
  Pol. Mad for thy love?  
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
            But never doubt I love.
    reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best, believe
    Receiv'd his love?
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
    Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
    for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do you

    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you
    Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?

  Ham. As woman's love.
      Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
      Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
      For women's fear and love holds quantity,
      Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
      Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
      Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
    King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;  
      Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
      Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
      That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
      Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
      And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
  Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see
    shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
  Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.
    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
    You cannot call it love; for at your age
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
    This mad young man. But so much was our love
    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
         How should I your true-love know
           With true-love showers.
    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
    After the thing it loves.
  Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
    Is the great love the general gender bear him,
    I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
  King. Not that I think you did not love your father;
    But that I know love is begun by time,
    There lives within the very flame of love
       In youth when I did love, did love,
    Could not (with all their quantity of love)
  Queen. For love of God, forbear him!
    As love between them like the palm might flourish,
  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
  Prince. Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.
    To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
    Betwixt my love and your high majesty.
    To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,
    But that I think his father loves him not
    To make us strangers to his looks of love.
    medicines to make me love him, I'll be hang'd. It could not be

    contented- why is he not then? In respect of the love he bears
    our house! He shows in this he loves his own barn better than he
    loves our house. Let me see some more. 'The purpose you undertake
    And I must know it, else he loves me not.
  Hot. Why, my horse, my love- my horse!
  Hot. So far afoot, I shall be weary, love.
    Away, you trifler! Love? I love thee not;
  Lady. Do you not love me? do you not indeed?
    Well, do not then; for since you love me not,
    I will not love myself. Do you not love me?
    I love thee infinitely. But hark you. Kate:
  Fal. Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!
    thy father. If thou love file, practise an answer.
    then Pharaoh's lean kine are to be loved. No, my good lord.
    Many an English ditty lovely well,
    But I will never be a truant, love,
    I love him well; he is an honest man.
  Fal. A thousand pound, Hal? A million! Thy love is worth a million;
    thou owest me thy love.
    In my heart's love hath no man than yourself.
    Some of us love you well; and even those some
  Blunt. I would you would accept of grace and love.
    That even our love thirst not come near your sight
    We love our people well; even those we love
    If I were much in love with vanity!
    Pardon, and terms of love to all of you?
    Must glove this hand; and hence, thou sickly coif!
    Their over-greedy love hath surfeited.
    indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my
    To make strength stronger; but, for all our loves,
    nor no cheater; but I do not love swaggering, by my troth. I am
    chops. Ah, rogue! i' faith, I love thee. Thou art as valorous as
  DOLL. Why does the Prince love him so, then?
  DOLL. I love thee better than I love e'er a scurvy young boy of
    in love with thee; in which doing, I have done the part of a

    fine shoot. John a Gaunt loved him well, and betted much money on
    Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love
    And it proceeds from policy, not love.
    That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,
    Of our restored love and amity.
    You would drink freely; but my love to ye
    of thy lovers, and they weep for thy death; therefore rouse up

    He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas.
    Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,
  CLARENCE. I shall observe him with all care and love.
    Which nature, love, and filial tenderness,
    That thou mightst win the more thy father's love,
  WARWICK. Indeed, I think the young king loves you not.
    Let me but bear your love, I'll bear your cares.
    You are, I think, assur'd I love you not.
 ELY. And a true lover of the holy Church.
  KING HENRY. Alas, your too much love and care of me
    You know how apt our love was to accord
  PISTOL. Come, let's away. My love, give me thy lips.
    Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin
    For husbands, fathers, and betrothed lovers,
    gloves or their handkerchers; which makes much against my
    man that I love and honour with my soul, and my heart, and my
    The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well.
  FLUELLEN. Ay, I praise God; and I have merited some love at his
  KING HENRY. 'Tis good for men to love their present pains
    I love the lovely bully. What is thy name?
  KING HENRY. I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here
  WILLIAMS. Here's my glove; give me another of thine.
    and say, after to-morrow, 'This is my glove,' by this hand I will
    And time hath worn us into slovenry.
    A testament of noble-ending love.
  KING HENRY. Soldier, why wear'st thou that glove in thy cap?
    glove, I have sworn to take him a box o' th' ear; or if I can see
    my glove in his cap- which he swore, as he was a soldier, he
    pluck'd this glove from his helm. If any man challenge this, he
    encounter any such, apprehend him, an thou dost me love.
    two legs that shall find himself aggrief'd at this glove, that is
    The glove which I have given him for a favour
  WILLIAMS. Sir, know you this glove?
  FLUELLEN. Know the glove? I know the glove is a glove.
    your Grace, has struck the glove which your Majesty is take out
  WILLIAMS. My liege, this was my glove: here is the fellow of it;
    glove in his cap, and I have been as good as my word.  
    avouchment, that this is the glove of Alencon that your Majesty
  KING HENRY. Give me thy glove, soldier; look, here is the fellow of
  KING HENRY. Here, uncle Exeter, fill this glove with crowns,
    this leek; because, look you, you do not love it, nor your
    Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love.
  BURGUNDY. My duty to you both, on equal love,
    Our fertile France, put up her lovely visage?
    The freckled cowslip, burnet, and green clover,
    And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
  KING HENRY. O fair Katherine, if you will love me soundly with your
    farm to buy my crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but
    directly to say 'I love you.' Then, if you urge me farther than
    should quickly leap into wife. Or if I might buffet for my love,
    till urg'd, nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a
    that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there,
    canst love me for this, take me; if not, to say to thee that I
    shall die is true- but for thy love, by the Lord, no; yet I love
    to my love? Speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.
  KATHERINE. Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?
  KING HENRY. No, it is not possible you should love the enemy of
    France, Kate, but in loving me you should love the friend of
    France; for I love France so well that I will not part with a
    English- Canst thou love me?
    Come, I know thou lovest me; and at night, when you come into
    love with your heart. But, good Kate, mock me mercifully; the
    rather, gentle Princess, because I love thee cruelly. If ever
    English, I love thee, Kate; by which honour I dare not swear thou
    lovest me; yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost,
    love her; and that is good English.
    flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in
    conjure up love in her in his true likeness, he must appear naked
  KING HENRY. Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and
  BURGUNDY. As love is, my lord, before it loves.
  KING HENRY. It is so; and you may, some of you, thank love for my
  KING HENRY. I pray you, then, in love and dear alliance,
    As man and wife, being two, are one in love,
  PUCELLE. I must not yield to any rites of love,
  WARWICK. I love no colours; and, without all colour  
    Meantime, in signal of my love to thee,
    To join your hearts in love and amity.
    And if you love me, as you say you do,
    Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.
    The presence of a king engenders love
    Burns under feigned ashes of forg'd love
    Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,
    Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both.
    So let us still continue peace and love.
    If you forsake the offer of their love.
    I owe him little duty and less love,
    And shall I fly? O, if you love my mother,
    Before thou make a trial of her love?
  SUFFOLK. His love.
    Never yet taint with love, I send the King.
    It was Alencon that enjoy'd my love.
    Do breed love's settled passions in my heart;
    Where I may have fruition of her love.
    The chief perfections of that lovely dame,
    To love and honour Henry as her lord.
    To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.
    As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love.
    With any passion of inflaming love,
    With hope to find the like event in love
    I can express no kinder sign of love
    If sympathy of love unite our thoughts.
    Lords, with one cheerful voice welcome my love.
  WARWICK. So God help Warwick, as he loves the land
    And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,
    Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love
  GLOUCESTER. O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy lord,  
  QUEEN. And as for you, that love to be protected  
    Thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love
    His study is his tilt-yard, and his loves
    As I in duty love my king and country!
    With him the husband of this lovely lady;
    They know their master loves to be aloft,
    To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk;
    And mere instinct of love and loyalty,
  CADE. And you that love the commons follow me.
  QUEEN. Ah, barbarous villains! Hath this lovely face  
    I fear me, love, if that I had been dead,
  QUEEN. No, my love, I should not mourn, but die for thee.
    Who loves the King, and will embrace his pardon,  
    And show'd how well you love your Prince and country.
    As pledges of my fealty and love.
    A poor esquire of Kent that loves his king.
  YORK. With thy brave bearing should I be in love
    Hath no self-love; nor he that loves himself
  WARWICK. Neither the King, nor he that loves him best,
  KING HENRY. Poor queen! How love to me and to her son
    Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!
    You love the breeder better than the male.
    'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.
    Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!
    Not that I fear to stay, but love to go
    My love and fear glu'd many friends to thee;
  RICHARD. Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.
  KING HENRY. From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,
  KING EDWARD. Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?
  LADY GREY. Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.
  KING EDWARD. An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.
  KING EDWARD. But stay thee- 'tis the fruits of love I mean.
  LADY GREY. The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.
    What love, thinkst thou, I sue so much to get?
  LADY GREY. My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
    That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.
  KING EDWARD. No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.
    And she shall be my love, or else my queen.
    And that is to enjoy thee for my love.
    Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb;
    That Henry, sole possessor of my love,
    I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,
    Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,
    Tell me for truth the measure of his love
    That this his love was an eternal plant
    Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;
    This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.
  QUEEN MARGARET. Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;
  KING EDWARD. My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns.
    Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,
    You that love me and Warwick, follow me.
    Stay not for the love of Edward but the crown.
    Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?
    Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love;
    For love of Edward's offspring in my womb.
    Then why should they love Edward more than me?
    More than the nature of a brother's love.
    I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.
    And this word 'love,' which greybeards call divine,
  KING EDWARD. Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;
  GLOUCESTER. And that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,
    Having my country's peace and brothers' loves.
    That you would love yourself, and in that love
    To gain the love o' th' commonalty; the Duke
  SANDYS. O, very mad, exceeding mad, in love too.
    If I but knew him, with my love and duty
    They love and dote on; call him bounteous Buckingham,
    Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels,
    Of her that loves him with that excellence
    That angels love good men with; even of her
    I love him not, nor fear him-there's my creed;
    And thank the holy conclave for their loves.
  CAMPEIUS. Your Grace must needs deserve an strangers' loves,
    Have I not strove to love, although I knew  
    My bond to wedlock or my love and duty,
    My learn'd and well-beloved servant, Cranmer,
    Out with it boldly; truth loves open dealing.
  WOLSEY. Madam, you wrong the King's love with these fears;
    His love too long ago! I am old, my lords,
    So much they love it; but to stubborn spirits
    Such doubts as false coin from it. The King loves you;
    My heart dropp'd love, my pow'r rain'd honour, more
    As 'twere in love's particular, be more
    And an that love his follies.
    Is held no great good lover of the Archbishop's,
    The model of our chaste loves, his young daughter-
    To love her for her mother's sake, that lov'd him,
    By that you love the dearest in this world,
  LOVELL. My lord, I love you;
    And of a lovely boy. The God of Heaven
    Am for his love and service so to him.
    Embrace and love this man.
    And brother-love I do it.  
    And so stand fix'd. Peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,
    With very easy arguments of love,
    Subjected tribute to commanding love,
    Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither.
    But with a heart full of unstained love;
    As seal to this indenture of my love:
    To make a more requital to your love!
    England we love, and for that England's sake
    And out of my dear love I'll give thee more
    Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid.
    If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,
    If zealous love should go in search of virtue,
    If love ambitious sought a match of birth,
    Can in this book of beauty read 'I love,'
    Himself love's traitor. This is pity now,
    In such a love so vile a lout as he.
    I will enforce it eas'ly to my love.
    That all I see in you is worthy love,
  KING JOHN. Speak then, Prince Dauphin; can you love this lady?
  LEWIS. Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love;  
    For I do love her most unfeignedly.
    For then I should not love thee; no, nor thou
    Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love,
    So newly join'd in love, so strong in both,
    Save what is opposite to England's love.
  BLANCH. Now shall I see thy love. What motive may
    Thy grandam loves thee, and thy uncle will
    And with advantage means to pay thy love;
    But, ah, I will not! Yet I love thee well;
    I could be merry now. Hubert, I love thee.
    Death, death; O amiable lovely death!
    And buss thee as thy wife. Misery's love,
  KING PHILIP. Bind up those tresses. O, what love I note
    Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,
    I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert.
    I warrant I love you more than you do me.
    Or 'What good love may I perform for you?'
    Nay, you may think my love was crafty love,
    I have a way to will their loves again;
    Whose private with me of the Dauphin's love
    Swearing allegiance and the love of soul
    Dear amity and everlasting love.
    The love of him-and this respect besides,
    But I do love the favour and the form
  SALISBURY. And the like tender of our love we make,
    And show of love as I was wont to have;
    Over your friend that loves you.
    Forgets the shows of love to other men.
    To stale with ordinary oaths my love
  BRUTUS. I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.
    For let the gods so speed me as I love
  BRUTUS. That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
    I would not, so with love I might entreat you,  
    Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays,  
    Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus.
    Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,
    For in the ingrated love he bears to Caesar-
    If he love Caesar, all that he can do
    I can o'ersway him, for he loves to hear
    He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;
    By all your vows of love and that great vow
    Because I love you, I will let you know.
    Pardon me, Caesar, for my dear dear love
    And reason to my love is liable.
    well Metellus Cimber; Decius Brutus loves thee not; thou hast
                                        Thy lover, Artemidorus."
    Say I love Brutus and I honor him;  
    Say I fear'd Caesar, honor'd him, and loved him.
    Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
    With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.
    Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,
    Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.
    That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true!
    Friends am I with you all and love you all,
    Romans, countrymen, and lovers! Hear me for my cause, and be
    him I say that Brutus' love to Caesar was no less than his. If
    my answer: Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome
    that Caesar were dead to live all freemen? As Caesar loved me, I
    is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor,
    offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If
    depart- that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I
    You all did love him once, not without cause;
    It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
    Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;
    Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
    That love my friend, and that they know full well
    Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?
    When love begins to sicken and decay
    Which should perceive nothing but love from us,
  CASSIUS. Do not presume too much upon my love;
  CASSIUS. You love me not.  
    Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;
    When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better
    Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.
  CASSIUS. Have not you love enough to bear with me
  I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.               Drinks.
  OCTAVIUS. Not that we love words better, as you do.
  CASSIUS. Titinius, if thou lovest me,
    Even for that our love of old, I prithee,

     Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,
     Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
  Gon. Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;
     A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable.
     Beyond all manner of so much I love you.
     I find she names my very deed of love;

     Beloved sons, be yours; which to confirm,
     Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least,
     That good effects may spring from words of love.
     Or cease your quest of love?
     I would not from your love make such a stray

     Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund

     No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not love. Read thou this
     I know you do not love me; for your sisters
     Do you not love my sister?
  Edm. In honour'd love.
     And machination ceases. Fortune love you!
  Edm. To both these sisters have I sworn my love;

  MOTH. [Aside] He speaks the mere contrary: crosses love not him.
  ARMADO. I will hereupon confess I am in love. And as it is base for

    perhaps a hackney. But have you forgot your love?

    My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon;
    O, but for my love, day would turn to night!
  KING. By heaven, thy love is black as ebony.
  LONGAVILLE. Look, here's thy love: my foot and her face see.
  KING. But what of this? Are we not all in love?
    But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,
    A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind.
    A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
    For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love;
    Or for Love's sake, a word that loves all men;
    And who can sever love from charity?
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Nothing but this! Yes, as much love in rhyme
  KATHARINE. Madam, this glove.
    Some thousand verses of a faithful lover;
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.
    And every one his love-feat will advance
    And change you favours too; so shall your loves

    My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.

  DUMAIN. But what to me, my love? but what to me?
    With threefold love I wish you all these three.
    Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.
    Impose some service on me for thy love.

  MACBETH. My dearest love,
    By his loved mansionry that the heaven's breath
    The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,  
    Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you
    And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him
    Conduct me to mine host. We love him highly,
    Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
    How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me-
    The expedition of my violent love
    That had a heart to love, and in that heart
    Courage to make 's love known?
    Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
    Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall
    That I to your assistance do make love,
  MACBETH. So shall I, love, and so, I pray, be you.
    To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;
    From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;
    All is the fear and nothing is the love;
    Was once thought honest. You have loved him well;
    Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,
    Nothing in love. Now does he feel his title
    As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,
    Before we reckon with your several loves
  JULIET, beloved of Claudio  
    Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,
    I'll privily away. I love the people,
    From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
    shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love, may sigh it off.
    Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
    Your brother and his lover have embrac'd.
    When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,  
  JULIET. Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.

    For his advantage that I dearly love.
  ANGELO. Plainly conceive, I love you.
  ISABELLA. My brother did love Juliet,  
  ANGELO. He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.
  CLAUDIO. Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love with life
    Therefore fasten your ear on my advisings; to the love I have in  
    there she lost a noble and renowned brother, in his love toward

    Is he pardon'd; and for your lovely sake,
    Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.
  LORENZO, in love with Jessica
  SOLANIO. Why then you are in love.
  SOLANIO. Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad
    I love thee, and 'tis my love that speaks-
    I owe the most, in money and in love;
    And from your love I have a warranty
    To wind about my love with circumstance;
    chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love. But
    love me to madness, I shall never requite him.
    I would be friends with you, and have your love,  
    And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.
    And let us make incision for your love

    I am not bid for love; they flatter me;  
    For lovers ever run before the clock.
    To seal love's bonds new made than they are wont
  LORENZO. Lorenzo, and thy love.
  JESSICA. Lorenzo, certain; and my love indeed;
    For who love I so much? And now who knows  
    But love is blind, and lovers cannot see
    Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love,
    Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.
  LORENZO. Beshrew me, but I love her heartily,
    But more than these, in love I do deserve.
    Let it not enter in your mind of love;
    To courtship, and such fair ostents of love
  SOLANIO. I think he only loves the world for him.
    So likely an ambassador of love.
    There's something tells me- but it is not love-
    What treason there is mingled with your love.
    Which makes me fear th' enjoying of my love;
    'Tween snow and fire as treason and my love.
  BASSANIO. 'Confess' and 'love'
    If you do love me, you will find me out.
    With no less presence, but with much more love,  
    O love, be moderate, allay thy ecstasy,
    Let it presage the ruin of your love,
    By a beloved prince, there doth appear
    With oaths of love, at last- if promise last-
    To have her love, provided that your fortune  
    When I did first impart my love to you,
    Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.
    your love do not persuade you to come, let not my letter.'
  PORTIA. O love, dispatch all business and be gone!
    How dear a lover of my lord your husband,
    Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love,
    Being the bosom lover of my lord,  
    The which my love and some necessity
    How honourable ladies sought my love,
    But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,
    Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
  BASSANIO. Do all men kill the things they do not love?
    Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
  GRATIANO. I have a wife who I protest I love;
    In love and service to you evermore.
    [To ANTONIO]  Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake.
    [To BASSANIO]  And, for your love, I'll take this ring from you.
    And you in love shall not deny me this.

  LYSANDER. You have her father's love, Demetrius;
  EGEUS. Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;
    And what is mine my love shall render him;
    As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
    Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,
    Come, my Hippolyta; what cheer, my love?
  LYSANDER. How now, my love! Why is your cheek so pale?
    The course of true love never did run smooth;
  HERMIA. O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.
  HERMIA. If then true lovers have ever cross'd,  
    As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
    Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,
    By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
  LYSANDER. Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.
    Demetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!
  HERMIA. I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
  HERMIA. I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
  HELENA. The more I love, the more he hateth me.
    O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,  
    A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
    From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.
  BOTTOM. What is Pyramus? A lover, or a tyrant?
  QUINCE. A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.
    Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein: a lover is more condoling.  
  QUINCE. It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
    [Then speaking small] 'Ah Pyramus, my lover dear! Thy

    But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
    Playing on pipes of corn, and versing love

    Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
    And loos'd his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
    Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,
    She shall pursue it with the soul of love.
  DEMETRIUS. I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
    Tell you I do not nor I cannot love you?
  HELENA. And even for that do I love you the more.
    What worser place can I beg in your love,
    Into the hands of one that loves you not;
    We cannot fight for love as men may do;
    To die upon the hand I love so well.             Exit HELENA
    Thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love.
    A sweet Athenian lady is in love
    More fond on her than she upon her love.
               Come our lovely lady nigh.
    Do it for thy true-love take;
  LYSANDER. Fair love, you faint with wand'ring in the wood;
    Love takes the meaning in love's conference.
    But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy
    Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!
             This flower's force in stirring love.
             Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.
             When thou wak'st let love forbid
    What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?
    Yet Hermia still loves you; then be content.
    Not Hermia but Helena I love:
    And, all my powers, address your love and might
    Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.
    Most brisky juvenal, and eke most lovely Jew,
    On the first view, to say, to swear, I love thee.
    And yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little company
    And I do love thee; therefore, go with me.
    To have my love to bed and to arise;
    Tie up my love's tongue, bring him silently.          Exeunt
  PUCK. My mistress with a monster is in love.
    With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?
  DEMETRIUS. O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
    And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight.
    Some true love turn'd, and not a false turn'd true.
    With sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear.
                When his love he doth espy,
                Pleading for a lover's fee;
  LYSANDER. Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.
    To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?
    You both are rivals, and love Hermia;
    For you love Hermia. This you know I know;
    In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;
    Whom I do love and will do till my death.
    If e'er I lov'd her, all that love is gone.
    Look where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.
  LYSANDER. Why should he stay whom love doth press to go?
  HERMIA. What love could press Lysander from my side?
  LYSANDER. Lysander's love, that would not let him bide-
    Two lovely berries moulded on one stern;
    And will you rent our ancient love asunder,
    And made your other love, Demetrius,
    Deny your love, so rich within his soul,
    So hung upon with love, so fortunate,
    But miserable most, to love unlov'd?
    My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena!
    Helen, I love thee, by my life I do;
    To prove him false that says I love thee not.
  DEMETRIUS. I say I love thee more than he can do.
    Sweet love?
  LYSANDER. Thy love! Out, tawny Tartar, out!
    Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love?
    That I do hate thee and love Helena.
    You thief of love! What! Have you come by night,
    And stol'n my love's heart from him?
    I evermore did love you, Hermia,
    Save that, in love unto Demetrius,
    He followed you; for love I followed him;
    Never so little show of love to her,
  OBERON. Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight.
    And back to Athens shall the lovers wend
    I with the Morning's love have oft made sport;
          Gentle lover, remedy.
  TITANIA. What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?
  TITANIA. Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.
    O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!         [They sleep]
  OBERON. There lies your love.
    There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
    My love shall hear the music of my hounds.  
    But by some power it is- my love to Hermia,
    Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,
  THESEUS. Fair lovers, you are fortunately met;
  HIPPOLYTA. 'Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.
    The lunatic, the lover, and the poet,
    That is the madman. The lover, all as frantic,
  THESEUS. Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.
    Joy, gentle friends, joy and fresh days of love
    We'll none of that: that have I told my love,
    And his love Thisby; very tragical mirth.'
  HIPPOLYTA. I love not to see wretchedness o'er-charged,
    Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
    By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
    Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain,
    Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,
    Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.
    And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,
    Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,
  THISBY. My love! thou art my love, I think.
  PYRAMUS. Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;
  THISBY. This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?
    and finds her lover?  
  THISBY.      Asleep, my love?
  Bene. Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I am loved of
    heart that I had not a hard heart, for truly I love none.
    than a man swear he loves me.
    my allegiance! he is in love. With who? Now that is your Grace's
  Pedro. Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.
  Claud. That I love her, I feel.
  Bene. That I neither feel how she should be loved, nor know how she
  Pedro. I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.
    love. Prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get
  Pedro. My love is thine to teach. Teach it but how,
    Than to drive liking to the name of love;
  Pedro. Thou wilt be like a lover presently
    If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,
  Claud. How sweetly you do minister to love,
    That know love's grief by his complexion!  
    Look, what will serve is fit. 'Tis once, thou lovest,
    a man of mine: the Prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my
    fashion a carriage to rob love from any. In this, though I cannot
  Pedro. Speak low if you speak love.         [Takes her aside.]
  Balth. I love you the better. The hearers may cry Amen.
  John. Signior, you are very near my brother in his love. He is
  Claud. How know you he loves her?
    Save in the office and affairs of love.
    Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues;
  Bene. O God, sir, here's a dish I love not! I cannot endure my Lady
  Claud. To-morrow, my lord. Time goes on crutches till love have all
    your cousin, that she shall fall in love with Benedick; and I,
    stomach, he shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,
    the only love-gods. Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift.
    Claudio alone; tell them that you know that Hero loves me; intend
    a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio, as--in love of
    another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviours to love,
    become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love; and such
    love may transform me to an oyster; but I'll take my oath on it,
    Yet will he swear he loves.
    your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick?
    --I did never think that lady would have loved any man.
    that she loves him with an enraged affection. It is past the
    that I love him?'"
    love him, I should.'
    if he love her not, and she will die ere she make her love known,
  Pedro. She doth well. If she should make tender of her love, 'tis
    her love?
    cool the while. I love Benedick well, and I could wish he would
    myself proudly if I perceive the love come from her. They say too
    her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her. I may chance
    alters? A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure
    some marks of love in her.
    do not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not love her, I
    Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter
    That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?
  Hero. O god of love! I know he doth deserve
    All matter else seems weak. She cannot love,
    She knew his love, lest she'll make sport at it.
    And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,
    If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee
    To bind our loves up in a holy band;
  Claud. I hope he be in love.
    truly touch'd with love. If he be sad, he wants money.
  Claud. Yet say I he is in love.
  Claud. If he be not in love with some woman, there is no believing
  Claud. That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love.
    he is in love.
  Claud. Nay, but I know who loves him.
  John. You may think I love you not. Let that appear hereafter, and
    wedding day. If you love her then, to-morrow wed her. But it
  Marg. Clap's into 'Light o' love.' That goes without a burden. Do
  Beat. Yea, 'Light o' love' with your heels! then, if your husband
  Hero. These gloves the Count sent me, they are an excellent
    in love. Nay, by'r lady, I am not such a fool to think what I
    love, or that you will be in love, or that you can be in love.
    Bashful sincerity and comely love.
    For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,
    Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?
    And every lovely organ of her life
    (If ever love had interest in his liver)
    And though you know my inwardness and love
  Bene. I do love nothing in the world so well as you. Is not that  
    me to say I loved nothing so well as you. But believe me not; and
  Bene. By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.
  Bene. I will swear by it that you love me, and I will make him eat
    it that says I love not you.
  Bene. With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest I love

  Beat. I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to
  Beat. I am gone, though I am here. There is no love in you. Nay, I

  Beat. Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.

    love of Beatrice.
    How innocent she died; and if your love
       [Sings] The god of love,
    over and over as my poor self in love. Marry, I cannot show it in
    for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?
    them. But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love
  Bene. Suffer love!--a good epithet. I do suffer love indeed, for I
    love thee against my will.  
    love that which my friend hates.
  Bene. Serve God, love me, and mend. There will I leave you too, for
  Bene. And I do with an eye of love requite her.
    When he would play the noble beast in love.
  Bene. Do not you love me?
  Beat. Do not you love me?
  Bene. 'Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?
  Leon. Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.
  Claud. And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her;
    that thou art like to be my kinsman, live unbruis'd, and love my
    To love the Moor.
    Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,
    I must show out a flag and sign of love,
    That the magnifico is much beloved,
    But that I love the gentle Desdemona,
    Of my whole course of love: what drugs, what charms,
    To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!
    How I did thrive in this fair lady's love
  OTHELLO. Her father loved me, oft invited me,
    And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
    She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,
    And I loved her that she did pity them.
    Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers
  DESDEMONA. That I did love the Moor to live with him,
    The rites for which I love him are bereft me,
    Of love, of worldly matters and direction,
  IAGO. If thou dost, I shall never love thee after.
    an injury, I never found man that knew how to love himself. Ere I
    would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen, I
    our unbitted lusts; whereof I take this, that you call love, to
    continue her love to the Moor- put money in thy purse- nor he his
    Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,
    But that our loves and comforts should increase,
    I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,
    be'st valiant- as they say base men being in love have then a
    must tell thee this: Desdemona is directly in love with him.
    with what violence she first loved the Moor, but for bragging and  
    telling her fantastical lies. And will she love him still for
    loveliness in favor, sympathy in years, manners, and beauties-
    she had been blest, she would never have loved the Moor. Blest
  IAGO. That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;
    That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit.
    A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too,
    Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me
    Let me have speech with you. Come, my dear love,
    general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona; who let
  IAGO. And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?
    Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,
    I do love Cassio well, and would do much
    Speak: who began this? On thy love, I charge thee.
    Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,
    Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee,
    Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!
    think you think I love you.
    love shall grow stronger than it was before.
  IAGO. I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.
    His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,
    music, that he desires you, for love's sake, to make no more
    He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you
  DESDEMONA. I know't: I thank you. You do love my lord:
    My general will forget my love and service.
    For if he be not one that truly loves you,
    To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.
    'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
    Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,
    But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,
    Know of your love?
    Some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me,
  IAGO. My lord, you know I love you.
    And for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty
    Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;
    Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!
    To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,
    Away at once with love or jealousy!
    To show the love and duty that I bear you
    She loved them most.
    Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved;
    Than keep a corner in the thing I love
    Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,
  OTHELLO. Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore;
    I'll love no friend sith love breeds such offense.
    Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,
    Let us be wary, let us hide our loves";
    All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.
    Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne
    Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,
  OTHELLO.                     I greet thy love,
    Entirely to her love, but if she lost it
    Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,
    Exist and be a member of his love
    Can ransom me into his love again,
    I'faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.
    Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,  
  CASSIO. Not that I love you not.
  BIANCA.                          But that you do not love me.
  IAGO. I never knew a woman love man so.
  CASSIO. Alas, poor rogue! I think, i'faith, she loves me.
    will marry her, out of her own love and flattery, not out of my
    To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.
  OTHELLO. To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?
    Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet
    If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love
    To beggarly divorcement, love him dearly,
    But never taint my love. I cannot say "whore."
  DESDEMONA. So would not I. My love doth so approve him,
    She was in love, and he she loved proved mad
        "I call'd my love false love; but what said he then?
    And love thee after. One more, and this the last;
    It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.
  DESDEMONA.                  They are loves I bear to you.
  OTHELLO. That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee
    Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio
    As I might love. I never gave him token.
  EMILIA. O mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love!
    With that recognizance and pledge of love
    Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;
    Of one that loved not wisely but too well;
    In the devotion of a subject's love,
    Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?
    Embrace each other's love in banishment;
    I wander from the jewels that I love.
    Love they to live that love and honour have.
    He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear
  KING RICHARD. Right, you say true: as Hereford's love, so his;
  GREEN. Besides, our nearness to the King in love
    Is near the hate of those love not the King.
  BAGOT. And that is the wavering commons; for their love
    And as my fortune ripens with thy love,
    It shall be still thy true love's recompense.
  BOLINGBROKE. Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues
    Shall be your love and labour's recompense.
    Near to the King in blood, and near in love
    With letters of your love to her at large.
  SCROOP. Sweet love, I see, changing his property,
    Me rather had my heart might feel your love
    As my true service shall deserve your love.
    Tears show their love, but want their remedies.
    Little are we beholding to your love,
    And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.
    The love of wicked men converts to fear;
  KING RICHARD. Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.
  NORTHUMBERLAND. That were some love, but little policy.
    And yet I love him.
    And from the common'st creature pluck a glove  
    To win thy after-love I pardon thee.
    Shall I, for love, speak treason to thy face?
    Fear, and not love, begets his penitence.
    For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard
  KING RICHARD. If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away.
  BOLINGBROKE. They love not poison that do poison need,
    I hate the murderer, love him murdered.
    I-that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
    And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover
    Simple, plain Clarence, I do love thee so
    The which will I-not all so much for love
    To be reveng'd on him that loveth thee.
  GLOUCESTER. He lives that loves thee better than he could.  
    This hand, which for thy love did kill thy love,
    Shall for thy love kill a far truer love;
    A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman-
    And then return lamenting to my love.
    A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
    And loves not me, be you, good lord, assur'd
    That I, forsooth, am stern and love them not?
    By holy Paul, they love his Grace but lightly
    That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
  CLARENCE. My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
  FIRST MURDERER. Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy
  CLARENCE. If you do love my brother, hate not me;
    I am his brother, and I love him well.
  CLARENCE. O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear.
    And charg'd us from his soul to love each other,
    Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.
    And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.
  HASTINGS. So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!
  RIVERS. And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!
    Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
  KING EDWARD. Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love Lord
  DORSET. This interchange of love, I here protest,
    Upon your Grace, but with all duteous love
    With hate in those where I expect most love!
    When I am cold in love to you or yours.
    Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate,
    I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
  GLOUCESTER. Why, madam, have I off'red love for this,
    Who spoke of brotherhood? Who spoke of love?
  DUCHESS. Peace, children, peace! The King doth love you
    And he would love me dearly as a child.
    Now cheer each other in each other's love.
  CATESBY. He for his father's sake so loves the Prince
    Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.  
  HASTINGS. I thank his Grace, I know he loves me well;
    His lordship knows me well and loves me well.
    Can lesser hide his love or hate than he;
  HASTINGS. The tender love I bear your Grace, my lord,
    The rest that love me, rise and follow me.
    I bid them that did love their country's good
    Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard.'
    He is not lolling on a lewd love-bed,
    By heaven, we come to him in perfect love;
    So season'd with your faithful love to me,
    Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert
  BUCKINGHAM. Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.
  BUCKINGHAM. If you refuse it-as, in love and zeal,
    On pure heart's love, to greet the tender Princes.
    Hath he set bounds between their love and me?
  ANNE. Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother.
    And I will love thee and prefer thee for it.
  KING RICHARD. Then know, that from my soul I love thy
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. That thou dost love my daughter from
    So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers,
    And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.
    I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter
    If this inducement move her not to love,
  KING RICHARD. Say that I did all this for love of her.
    Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
    A grandam's name is little less in love
    That God, the law, my honour, and her love
  KING RICHARD. Say I will love her everlastingly.
    To my proceeding!-if, with dear heart's love,
    Be the attorney of my love to her;
  KING RICHARD. Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.
    Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
    God give us leisure for these rites of love!
    Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
    Alack, I love myself. Wherefore? For any good
    I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;
    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
  Ben. In love?
  Ben. Of love?
  Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love.
  Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,
  Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
    Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
    Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!  
    This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
  Rom. Why, such is love's transgression.
    With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
    Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
    Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.
  Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
    In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
  Rom. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.
    She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
    Such as I love; and you among the store,
      Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces;
    One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun
    Your lady's love against some other maid
    The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
  Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?
    This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
  Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
  Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings
    Under love's heavy burthen do I sink.
  Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-
  Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
  Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.
    Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
    Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
    Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
    thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
    Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!
  Jul. My only love, sprung from my only hate!
    Prodigious birth of love it is to me
    That I must love a loathed enemy.
    That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
    Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,
    And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
    To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,
    And she as much in love, her means much less
    To meet her new beloved anywhere;
    Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
    Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove';
    Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
  Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
    It is my lady; O, it is my love!
    O that I were a glove upon that hand,
    Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
    Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;
  Rom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;
    For stony limits cannot hold love out,
    And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
    And but thou love me, let them find me here.
    Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
  Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.
    Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';  
    Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,
    If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
    My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,
    And not impute this yielding to light love,
    Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
  Rom. If my heart's dear love-
    This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
  Rom. Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
  Rom. Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
    My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
    I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!
    If that thy bent of love be honourable,
    Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;
    But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.
    How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
    Rememb'ring how I love thy company.
  Rom. Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
    Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
    So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies
    To season love, that of it doth not taste!
  Rom. And bad'st me bury love.
  Rom. I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now
    Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
    Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
    To turn your households' rancour to pure love.

    better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,
  Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art  
    art as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a
  Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and will  
    My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
    Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?  
  Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,
    'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
    To fetch a ladder, by the which your love  
    Then love-devouring death do what he dare-
    Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
    A lover may bestride the gossamer
    But my true love is grown to such excess
  Tyb. Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
  Rom. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
    But love thee better than thou canst devise
    Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;
    Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
    By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
    With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,
    Think true love acted simple modesty.
    That all the world will be in love with night
    O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
    Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
    My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
    Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
    Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
    Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
    Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
    Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
    Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.  
    Go get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
    Of my child's love. I think she will be rul'd
    Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love
    Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
    No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks
  Jul. Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend?
    That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
  Rom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
    Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;
    To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt
    But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
    To answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love;
    O, he's a lovely gentleman!
    And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
  Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
  Par. Do not deny to him that you love me.
  Jul. I will confess to you that I love him.
  Par. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
    To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
    And gave him what becomed love I might,
    Why, love, I say! madam! sweetheart! Why, bride!
    O love! O life! not life, but love in death
    O, in this love, you love your child so ill
    Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
    When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
    To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
    That murd'red my love's cousin- with which grief
    By heaven, I love thee better than myself,

    Here's to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!
    One that you love.
    What's here? A cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?
    Their course of love, the tidings of her death;

    Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,
    And by my father's love and leave am arm'd

    Because I know you well and love you well,

    out; our cake's dough on both sides. Farewell; yet, for the love
    our fair mistress, and be happy rivals in Bianca's love- to
    That love should of a sudden take such hold?
    I found the effect of love in idleness;
    If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so:
    I pray, awake, sir. If you love the maid,
    Master, your love must live a maid at home;
    Because so well I love Lucentio.
  LUCENTIO. Tranio, be so because Lucentio loves;
    My best beloved and approved friend,
    Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,
    Suitors to her and rivals in my love;
    Have leave and leisure to make love to her,
  HORTENSIO. Peace, Grumio! It is the rival of my love. Petruchio,
    All books of love, see that at any hand;
    To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.
  GREMIO. Beloved of me- and that my deeds shall prove.  
  HORTENSIO. Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love.
  TRANIO. I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.
    That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.
    And for your love to her lead apes in hell.
    Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,  
    That is, her love; for that is all in all.
    I love her ten times more than e'er I did.
    How much she loves me- O, the kindest Kate!
    That in a twink she won me to her love.
  TRANIO. And I am one that love Bianca more
  GREMIO. Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.
  TRANIO. Greybeard, thy love doth freeze.
    Shall have my Bianca's love.
    thus to get your love- 'Hic steterat' and that Lucentio that
    Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love.
         "C fa ut" that loves with all affection-
    Methinks he looks as though he were in love.
    But where is Kate? Where is my lovely bride?
    And seal the title with a lovely kiss!
  TRANIO. But to her love concerneth us to ad
  KATHERINA. Now, if you love me, stay.  
    And serve it thus to me that love it not?
  TRANIO. O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
    Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.
    Shall win my love; and so I take my leave,
    As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
    Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,
    Take in your love, and then let me alone.
    He does it under name of perfect love;
  KATHERINA. A dish that I do love to feed upon.
    Here, love, thou seest how diligent I am,
  PETRUCHIO.  [Aside]  Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lovest me.-
    Kate, eat apace. And now, my honey love,
    I love thee well in that thou lik'st it not.  
  KATHERINA. Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
    Of love between your daughter and himself;
    And for the love he beareth to your daughter,
    Doth love my daughter, and she loveth him,
    Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.  
    Allots thee for his lovely bed-fellow.
  PETRUCHIO. Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua. Do
  LUCENTIO. Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
  KATHERINA. Nay, I will give thee a kiss; now pray thee, love, stay.
  PETRUCHIO. Marry, peace it bodes, and love, and quiet life,
    But love, fair looks, and true obedience-
    When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.
  BOATSWAIN. None that I more love than myself. You are
    So dear the love my people bore me; nor set
    Into a cloven pine; within which rift
    I do not love to look on.
    And I the King shall love thee.
    All wound with adders, who with cloven tongues

    Do love, prize, honour you.

    A contract of true love; be not too late.  
  FERDINAND. No, my dearest love,

    To Apemantus, that few things loves better
    Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants,
    Attempts her love; I prithee, noble lord,  
  TIMON. Does she love him?
    labour. He that loves to be flattered is worthy o' th' flatterer.
    That there should be small love amongst these sweet knaves,
    Honest Ventidius! You mistake my love;
        TIMON; and to show their loves, each single out an
    free love, hath presented to you four milk-white horses, trapp'd
    Here, my lord, a trifle of our love.
    Have smit my credit. I love and honour him,
  FOOL. I do not always follow lover, elder brother, and woman;
    If I would broach the vessels of my love,
    Commend me to their loves; and I am proud, say, that my occasions
    So much I love his heart. But I perceive
    It shows but little love or judgment in him.
    Of such a nature is his politic love.
    And, for I know your reverend ages love
    beloved more than the man that gives it. Let no assembly of
    That I might love thee something.
  TIMON. Be a whore still; they love thee not that use thee.
  APEMANTUS. I love thee better now than e'er I did.
    loved thyself better now. What man didst thou ever know unthrift
    that was beloved after his means?
    I am sick of this false world, and will love nought
  APEMANTUS. Live, and love thy misery!
    When man was wish'd to love his enemies!
    Grant I may ever love, and rather woo
  TIMON. What, dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I love thee
    That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,  
    our loves to him in this suppos'd distress of his; it will show
    Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,
  TIMON. Look you, I love you well; I'll give you gold,

  AARON, a Moor, beloved by Tamora
    And so I love and honour thee and thine,
    And to the love and favour of my country
    These that survive let Rome reward with love;
  MARCUS. Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother,
    That is another's lawful promis'd love.                 Exit
  SATURNINUS. And therefore, lovely Tamora, Queen of Goths,
    Your noble Emperor and his lovely bride,
    My true betrothed love, and now my wife?
    And at my lovely Tamora's entreats,
    This day shall be a love-day, Tamora.
    And plead my passions for Lavinia's love.
  AARON.  [Aside]  Clubs, clubs! These lovers will not keep the
    That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd
    I love Lavinia more than all the world.
    And cannot brook competitors in love?
    Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.
    Than this Lavinia, Bassianus' love.
    There will the lovely Roman ladies troop;
    And wake the Emperor and his lovely bride,
  TAMORA. My lovely Aaron, wherefore look'st thou sad
    And let her joy her raven-coloured love;
    Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,
    Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,
    As half thy love? Why dost not speak to me?
    But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee.
    Sends thee this word, that, if thou love thy sons,
    Now let me show a brother's love to thee.
    And if ye love me, as I think you do,
  TITUS. She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.
  MARCUS. For love of her that's gone,
  DEMETRIUS. Gramercy, lovely Lucius. What's the news?
  CHIRON. A charitable wish and full of love.
    For our beloved mother in her pains.
  TAMORA. My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,
    'Tis he the common people love so much;
    This do thou for my love; and so let him,
    For peace, for love, for league, and good to Rome.

    Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me
    Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love,
  PANDARUS. I swear to you I think Helen loves him better than Paris.
  PANDARUS. But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came and
    puts me her white hand to his cloven chin-
  CRESSIDA. Juno have mercy! How came it cloven?
  PANDARUS. Why, go to, then! But to prove to you that Helen loves
  CRESSIDA. If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
    Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,
    Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:
    Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,  
    In fortune's love? For then the bold and coward,
    That loves his mistress more than in confession
    With truant vows to her own lips he loves,
    To rouse a Grecian that is true in love.
  AGAMEMNON. This shall be told our lovers, Lord Aeneas.
    That means not, hath not, or is not in love.  
    To answer for his love, tell him from me
    You fur your gloves with reason. Here are your reasons:
  NESTOR. [Aside] And yet he loves himself: is't not strange?
  SERVANT. At mine, sir, and theirs that love music.
    the heart-blood of beauty, love's invisible soul-
  PANDARUS. My niece is horribly in love with a thing you have, sweet
  HELEN. Let thy song be love. This love will undo us all. O Cupid,
  PARIS. Ay, good now, love, love, nothing but love.
    Love, love, nothing but love, still love, still more!
           For, oh, love's bow
    These lovers cry, O ho, they die!
       So dying love lives still.
  HELEN. In love, i' faith, to the very tip of the nose.
  PARIS. He eats nothing but doves, love; and that breeds hot blood,
    deeds, and hot deeds is love.
  PANDARUS. Is this the generation of love: hot blood, hot thoughts,
    and hot deeds? Why, they are vipers. Is love a generation of
  PARIS. Sweet, above thought I love thee.                     Exeunt
    love?
    difficulty imposed. This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that
  CRESSIDA. They say all lovers swear more performance than they are
    I love you now; but till now not so much
  CRESSIDA. Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than love;
    Or else you love not; for to be wise and love
    To feed for aye her lamp and flames of love;
    Of such a winnowed purity in love.
    True swains in love shall in the world to come
    From false to false, among false maids in love,
    The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,
    'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love
    Farewell, my lord. I as your lover speak.
    And your great love to me restrains you thus.
    No man alive can love in such a sort
    The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of.  
    As tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love  
    No kin, no love, no blood, no soul so near me
    But the strong base and building of my love
  PARIS. I know what 'tis to love,
    My love admits no qualifying dross;
  TROILUS. Cressid, I love thee in so strain'd a purity
  TROILUS. Hear me, my love. Be thou but true of heart-
    For I will throw my glove to Death himself
  CRESSIDA. And you this glove. When shall I see you?
  TROILUS. Hear why I speak it, love.
  CRESSIDA. O heavens! you love me not.
    In love whereof half Hector stays at home;
    Is more vindicative than jealous love.
    Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove.  
    This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there
    But still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth.          Exeunt
    A token from her daughter, my fair love,
    enough, and one that loves quails, but he has not so much brain
    Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,
    The fractions of her faith, orts of her love,
    Hark, Greek: as much as I do Cressid love,
  TROILUS. For th' love of all the gods,  
    Upon the love you bear me, get you in.
    My love with words and errors still she feeds,
    that loves the whore there might send that Greekish whoremasterly
  THERSITES. I am a bastard too; I love bastards. I am a bastard
  DUKE. If music be the food of love, play on,
    O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou!
    A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh  
    To pay this debt of love but to a brother,
    How will she love when the rich golden shaft
    That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.
    Who shortly also died; for whose dear love,
    in question the continuance of his love. Is he inconstant, sir,
  DUKE. O, then unfold the passion of my love,
  OLIVIA. O, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a
    My lord and master loves you- O, such love
  OLIVIA. How does he love me?
    With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.  
  OLIVIA. Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love him.
    A gracious person; but yet I cannot love him.
  VIOLA. If I did love you in my master's flame,
    Write loyal cantons of contemned love
    I cannot love him; let him send no more-
    Love make his heart of flint that you shall love;
    were a bad recompense for your love to lay any of them on you.
  ANTONIO. If you will not murder me for my love, let me be your
    She loves me, sure: the cunning of her passion
    Poor lady, she were better love a dream.
    How will this fadge? My master loves her dearly,
    My state is desperate for my master's love;
CLOWN. Would you have a love-song, or a song of good life?
  SIR TOBY. A love-song, a love-song.
         O, stay and hear; your true love's coming,
           Journeys end in lovers meeting,
           What is love? 'Tis not hereafter;
  AGUECHEEK. An you love me, let's do't. I am dog at a catch.
  MARIA. For the love o' God, peace!
    of faith that all that look on him love him; and on that vice in
  MARIA. I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love;
    they come from my niece, and that she's in love with him.
    Come hither, boy. If ever thou shalt love,
    For such as I am all true lovers are,  
    Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves;
  DUKE. Then let thy love be younger than thyself,
    And dallies with the innocence of love,
          Sad true lover never find my grave,
    Tell her my love, more noble than the world,
  VIOLA. But if she cannot love you, sir?
    Hath for your love as great a pang of heart
    As you have for Olivia. You cannot love her;
    As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart
    Alas, their love may be call'd appetite-
    Between that love a woman can bear me
  VIOLA. Too well what love women to men may owe.
  VIOLA. A blank, my lord. She never told her love,
    Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?
    Much in our vows, but little in our love.
  DUKE. But died thy sister of her love, my boy?
    My love can give no place, bide no denay.             Exeunt
    his own shadow this half hour. Observe him, for the love of
                    Jove knows I love,
    every reason excites to this, that my lady loves me. She did
    cross-garter'd; and in this she manifests herself to my love, and
    entertain'st my love, let it appear in thy smiling; thy smiles
    chev'ril glove to a good wit. How quickly the wrong side may be
  OLIVIA. That's a degree to love.
    Than love that would seem hid: love's night is noon.
    I love thee so that, maugre all thy pride,
    That heart which now abhors to like his love.         Exeunt
  FABIAN. This was a great argument of love in her toward you.
    thyself there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in
    And not all love to see you- though so much
    Rough and unhospitable. My willing love,
  VIOLA. Nothing but this- your true love for my master.
  ANTONIO. One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more
    Reliev'd him with such sanctity of love,
    Tempests are kind, and salt waves fresh in love!        Exit
  CLOWN. [Sings] She loves another- Who calls, ha?
    My love without retention or restraint,
    Did I expose myself, pure for his love,
    Kill what I love?- a savage jealousy
    But this your minion, whom I know you love,
    I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love
  VIOLA. After him I love
    More than I love these eyes, more than my life,
    More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife.
    Punish my life for tainting of my love!
  PRIEST. A contract of eternal bond of love,
  AGUECHEEK. For the love of God, a surgeon!
    bloody coxcomb too. For the love of God, your help! I had rather
    Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.
  JULIA, a lady of Verona, beloved of Proteus
  SILVIA, the Duke's daughter, beloved of Valentine
    To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,
    But since thou lov'st, love still, and thrive therein,
    Even as I would, when I to love begin.
  VALENTINE. And on a love-book pray for my success?
  PROTEUS. Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
  VALENTINE. That's on some shallow story of deep love:
  PROTEUS. That's a deep story of a deeper love;
    For he was more than over shoes in love.
  VALENTINE. 'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
  VALENTINE. To be in love- where scorn is bought with groans,
  PROTEUS. 'Tis love you cavil at; I am not Love.
    The eating canker dwells, so eating love
    Even so by love the young and tender wit
    Of thy success in love, and what news else
  PROTEUS. He after honour hunts, I after love;
    I leave myself, my friends, and all for love.
    'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover.
    Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?
    In thy opinion which is worthiest love?
    Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.
  JULIA. And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
  LUCETTA. Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.
  LUCETTA. Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.
  JULIA. His little speaking shows his love but small.
  JULIA. They do not love that do not show their love.
  LUCETTA. O, they love least that let men know their love.
  LUCETTA. To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
    Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love,
  JULIA. Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
    And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
  PROTEUS. Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!
    Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.
    O that our fathers would applaud our loves,
    Lest he should take exceptions to my love;
    Hath he excepted most against my love.
    O, how this spring of love resembleth
  SPEED. Sir, your glove.
  VALENTINE. Not mine: my gloves are on.
  SPEED. She that your worship loves?
  VALENTINE. Why, how know you that I am in love?
    love-song, like a robin redbreast; to walk alone, like one that
  SPEED. If you love her, you cannot see her.
    being in love, could not see to garter his hose; and you, being
    in love, cannot see to put on your hose.
  VALENTINE. Belike, boy, then you are in love; for last morning you
  SPEED. True, sir; I was in love with my bed. I thank you, you
    swing'd me for my love, which makes me the bolder to chide you
    she loves.
    Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.'
    Torment me for my love's forgetfulness!
    Ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak;
    Alas! this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.          Exeunt
  VALENTINE. Ay, boy, it's for love.
    He is as worthy for an empress' love
  VALENTINE. To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself;
  VALENTINE. How does your lady, and how thrives your love?
  PROTEUS. My tales of love were wont to weary you;
    I know you joy not in a love-discourse.
    For, in revenge of my contempt of love,
    Now no discourse, except it be of love;
    Upon the very naked name of love.
  VALENTINE. O, flatter me; for love delights in praises!
    Except thou wilt except against my love.
    Because thou seest me dote upon my love.
    For love, thou know'st, is full of jealousy.
  PROTEUS. But she loves you?
    So the remembrance of my former love
    She is fair; and so is Julia that I love-
    That I did love, for now my love is thaw'd;
    And that I love him not as I was wont.
    O! but I love his lady too too much,
    And that's the reason I love him so little.
    That thus without advice begin to love her!  
    If I can check my erring love, I will;
    that my master is become a notable lover?
  SPEED. I tell thee my master is become a hot lover.
  LAUNCE. Why, I tell thee I care not though he burn himself in love.
    To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn;
    I cannot leave to love, and yet I do;  
    But there I leave to love where I should love.
    For love is still most precious in itself;
    Rememb'ring that my love to her is dead;
    And, ev'n in kind love, I do conjure thee,
    Didst thou but know the inly touch of love.
    As seek to quench the fire of love with words.
  LUCETTA. I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,
    Till the last step have brought me to my love;
    With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots-
    And instances of infinite of love,
    His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,
    Only deserve my love by loving him.
    This love of theirs myself have often seen,
    For which the youthful lover now is gone,
    For love of you, not hate unto my friend,
    Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;
    For scorn at first makes after-love the more.
    But rather to beget more love in you;
    By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love
    Here if thou stay thou canst not see thy love;
    Hope is a lover's staff; walk hence with that,
    Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.  
    Of all that may concern thy love affairs.
    one knave. He lives not now that knows me to be in love; yet I am
    in love; but a team of horse shall not pluck that from me; nor
    who 'tis I love; and yet 'tis a woman; but what woman I will not
  LAUNCE. I care not for that neither, because I love crusts.
  SPEED. Why didst not tell me sooner? Pox of your love letters!
  DUKE. Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you
  DUKE. This weak impress of love is as a figure
    The love of Valentine, and love Sir Thurio?
    She shall not long continue love to him.
    But say this weed her love from Valentine,
    It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.
  THURIO. Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,
    To hate young Valentine and love my friend.
  DUKE. This discipline shows thou hast been in love.
    I have access my own love to prefer;
    The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,
    Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love
  PROTEUS. Ay, gentle Thurio; for you know that love
  THURIO. Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here.
    Return, return, and make thy love amends.
  PROTEUS. I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady;  
    Assure thyself my love is buried.
    Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love,
    And to your shadow will I make true love.
    As when thy lady and thy true love died,
    As you do love your lady Silvia.
    She dreams on him that has forgot her love:
    You dote on her that cares not for your love.
    'Tis pity love should be so contrary;
    Because he loves her, he despiseth me;
    Because I love him, I must pity him.
    I am my master's true confirmed love,
    Since she respects my mistress' love so much.
    Alas, how love can trifle with itself!
    Were full as lovely as is this of hers;
    If that be all the difference in his love,
    To make my master out of love with thee.                Exit
    She will not fail, for lovers break not hours
  JULIA.  [Aside]  But love will not be spurr'd to what it loathes.
  THURIO. But well when I discourse of love and peace?  
    Than for the love of reckless Silvia.                   Exit
  PROTEUS. And I will follow, more for Silvia's love
  JULIA. And I will follow, more to cross that love
    Than hate for Silvia, that is gone for love.            Exit
    They love me well; yet I have much to do
    That would have forc'd your honour and your love.
    O, heaven be judge how I love Valentine,
    O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approv'd,
    When women cannot love where they're belov'd!
  SILVIA. When Proteus cannot love where he's belov'd!
    Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,
    Descended into perjury, to love me.
  PROTEUS. In love,
    And love you 'gainst the nature of love- force ye.
  VALENTINE. Thou common friend, that's without faith or love-
    And, that my love may appear plain and free,
    In a disguise of love.
    I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.
    His body for a girl that loves him not.
    And think thee worthy of an empress' love.
    The story of your loves discovered.
    justified in our loves; for indeed-
    loves!
    Were in your love a whip to me; my stay
    I love thee not a jar o' th' clock behind
    And clap thyself my love; then didst thou utter
    Who I do think is mine, and love as mine-
    Lov'd as he loves himself; even now I met him
    I were a baby still. I love you better.
    With such a kind of love as might become
    A lady like me; with a love even such,
    To you and toward your friend; whose love had spoke,
    The love I bore your queen- lo, fool again!
    Humbling their deities to love, have taken
  PERDITA. No; like a bank for love to lie and play on;
    He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter;
    Who loves another best.
  CLOWN. He could never come better; he shall come in. I love a
    can so fit his customers with gloves. He has the prettiest
    love-songs for maids; so without bawdry, which is strange; with
           Gloves as sweet as damask roses;
  CLOWN. If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take no
    bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.
    of sweet gloves.
  MOPSA. Pray now, buy some. I love a ballad in print a-life, for
  DORCAS.    Thou hast sworn my love to be.
    And handed love as you do, I was wont
    Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited  
    Without her love; for her employ them all;
    Save him from danger, do him love and honour,
    You have heard of my poor services i' th' love
    If you may please to think I love the King,
    Prosperity's the very bond of love,
    table-book, ballad, knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet,
    love with the wenches' song that he would not stir his pettitoes
  GENTLEMAN. Women will love her that she is a woman
    Measur'd, to look upon you; whom he loves,
    Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,
  Love to myself, and to no love beside.
  For feasts of love I have been called unto,
  To spend her living in eternal love.
  Religious love put out religion's eye.
  As compound love to physic your cold breast.
  O most potential love, vow, bond, nor space,  
  Who, young and simple, would not be so lovered?
